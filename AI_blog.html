			Although AI has taken the world by storm and could be the most searched keyword in IT industry but not everything that shines is gold. As artificial intelligence learns, it may inculcate algorithm bias and thereby impacting the final decision made by it. One of the few examples of unwanted bias is how Amazonâ€™s hiring algorithm discriminate against female job candidates. Also, how Apple card offered higher credit limits to male customers regardless of credit score. These unwanted bias limits the decision-making power of AI, which depicts that maybe AI still needs to append many things to become the future of automation industry.

			As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance and transform various industries, one area that is particularly poised for disruption is the healthcare industry. AI has the potential to improve patient outcomes, streamline processes, and reduce costs, but it also presents challenges and potential risks.

     <p>
		One of the main benefits of AI in healthcare is the ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. This can lead to more precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and faster drug development. For example, AI can analyze medical images to detect cancerous cells that may be missed by human eyes or predict a patient's risk of developing certain diseases based on their genetic information. Another area where AI can have a significant impact is in reducing healthcare costs. By automating routine tasks, such as scheduling appointments or managing medical records, healthcare providers can free up their staff's time to focus on more complex tasks. AI can also help identify areas where costs can be reduced, such as unnecessary tests or treatments.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		However, there are also potential risks associated with the use of AI in healthcare. One of the most significant concerns is the potential for bias in AI algorithms. If the data used to train these algorithms is not diverse enough, they may produce inaccurate results that disproportionately impact certain groups of people.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Additionally, there is a risk that AI could replace human healthcare professionals, leading to job loss and a decrease in the quality of care. However, many experts believe that AI will not replace healthcare professionals but rather augment their capabilities, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks that require human expertise. The implementation of AI in healthcare will also have a significant impact on careers in the industry. Healthcare professionals who embrace AI and are willing to learn new technologies will be in high demand. Jobs that involve tasks that can be automated, such as medical transcription or billing, may be at risk of being replaced by AI. However, there will also be a growing need for professionals with skills in data analytics, computer science, and AI.

	 <p>
		In conclusion, AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry, but it is not without its challenges and potential risks. Healthcare organizations must carefully consider the implications of implementing AI and take steps to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly. Those who are willing to adapt and learn new skills will be well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by AI in healthcare.
