								<h3>How to cultivate happiness in companies</h3>
								<p>A major problem especially in new start-ups where they emphasize more on their revenue, sales, profits, manufacturing, and investments but forgets the basic need of maintaining their work environment suitable for a happy employee. I believe that building a good work culture for your employees is a long-term investment to become a dark horse in your sector.</p>

								<h3>Designing AI for all bias in artificial intelligence system</h3>
								<p>Artificial intelligence is expected to have a significant impact on various industries, including manufacturing, transportation, and customer service. Organizations will need to adapt to these changes to remain competitive, which may involve restructuring and retraining employees. The trend may also create new job opportunities in fields such as data science and machine learning, while potentially reducing demand for certain types of manual labor. However, it remains to be seen how exactly the trend will play out in the long run and what its full implications will be for society as a whole.</p>
